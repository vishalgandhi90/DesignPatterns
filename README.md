# Design Patterns

As our header suggests , You have question in mind . 

What do design patterns mean? (Dont worry I do have same questions few months ago)

We are doing code but when it comes to CR (Change Request) to existing feature or replace few components in code . Its very difficult for us as we didnt think of in very scalable or resuable manner . Design Patterns bring solution to this problem . It looks very difficult for first time . By the time , Practice can help us to get expertise over this. 

When I first heard , I am getting troubles to find out easy examples of all popular design patterns. I would like to bring together all design patterns. It would be easier for swift developers to get understanding of these design patterns. 

I am adding factory design pattern with simple example. Add more patterns in coming week ....
